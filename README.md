# üõ∞Ô∏è ANAV Terrain Classifier ‚Äì YOLOv8 for Mars Navigation

This repository contains the machine learning component of the **Autonomous Aerial Navigation System for Mars Exploration (ANAV)** ‚Äì a mini project completed at Ramaiah Institute of Technology. This module focuses on training and deploying a **YOLOv8-based deep learning model** to classify Martian terrain into **safe**, **rocky**, and **transitional** zones to assist autonomous UAVs in decision-making during planetary exploration.

## üöÄ Project Context

Due to the absence of GPS on Mars and the harsh terrain, aerial robots need intelligent systems to autonomously identify safe landing zones and plan paths in real-time. This terrain classification module was designed to:
- Support **GNSS-denied navigation**
- Work with **visual-inertial odometry systems**
- Enable autonomous exploration, landing, and return
